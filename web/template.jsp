                        <p>In cloud computing, a fundamental application is to outsource the mobile data to
                            external cloud servers for scalable data storage. The outsourced data, however, need to be encrypted due
                            to the privacy and condentiality concerns of their owner. This results in the distinguished difculties on
                            the accurate search over the encrypted mobile cloud data. To tackle this issue, in this paper, we develop the
                            searchable encryption for multi-keyword ranked search over the storage data. Specically, by considering
                            the large number of outsourced documents (data) in the cloud, we utilize the relevance score and k-nearest
                            neighbor techniques to develop an efcient multi-keyword search scheme that can return the ranked search
                            results based on the accuracy. Within this framework, we leverage an efcient index to further improve the
                            search efciency, and adopt the blind storage system to conceal access pattern of the search user.
                        <p>
                            Security
                            analysis demonstrates that our scheme can achieve condentiality of documents and index, trapdoor privacy,
                            trapdoor unlinkability, and concealing access pattern of the search user. Finally, using extensive simulations,
                            we show that our proposal can achieve much improved efciency in terms of search functionality and search
                            time compared with the existing proposals.
